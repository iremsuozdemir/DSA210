# Project Proposal: Impact of Visa Approval Rates on Tourism in Europe
# 1. Research Question
How do visa approval and rejection rates affect tourist inflow in European countries?
This study aims to determine whether restrictive visa policies correlate with lower tourism numbers and how factors like safety, cost of living, and cultural significance influence this relationship.

# 2. Motivation
Tourism is a major economic driver for many countries, yet restrictive visa policies can significantly impact the number of visitors a country receives. This project aims to analyze the relationship between visa approval/rejection rates and tourist inflow in European countries. By identifying patterns and correlations, the study will provide insights into how visa policies shape travel behaviors and tourism revenues.

# 3. Data Sources
The project will integrate two datasets:

# Visitor Visa Statistics Dataset

Source: visadata.csv
Description: This dataset contains visa application data, including approval and rejection rates by country, consulate location, and year.
Key variables:
visitor_visa_applications: Total visa applications per country.
visitor_visa_issued: Approved visas per country.
visitor_visa_not_issued: Rejected visa applications.
visitor_visa_refusal_rate: Visa rejection percentage.
European Tour Destinations Dataset

Source: european-tour-destinations-dataset-metadata.csv
Description: This dataset contains information on popular tourist destinations in Europe, including annual tourist arrivals, safety scores, cost of living, and cultural significance.
Key variables:
Approximate Annual Tourists: Estimated number of tourists visiting each destination.
Safety: Perceived safety level in the destination.
Cost of Living: Economic affordability of the location.
Cultural Significance: Historical and cultural importance.
# 4. Methodology
The project will follow these key steps:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Merge the visa dataset with the tourism dataset based on country.
- Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform outlier detection.
- Convert categorical variables (e.g., safety levels, cultural significance) into numerical representations.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of visa rejection rates across countries.
- Relationship between visa approval rates and tourist arrivals.
- Correlation between visa policies, safety scores, and cost of living.
  
# Hypothesis Testing
Conduct a t-test or ANOVA to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in tourist numbers between countries with high and low visa rejection rates.
Perform correlation analysis to check the strength of the relationship between visa rejection rates and tourist inflow.
Data Visualization

Heatmaps to show visa rejection rates across Europe.
Scatter plots and regression analysis for visa approval rates vs. tourism numbers.
Time-series analysis (if applicable) to study trends over the years.
Predictive Modeling (Optional)

Build a regression model to predict expected tourist inflow based on visa policies, safety, and economic factors.
Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to categorize countries based on their tourism and visa policies.
# 5. Expected Findings
Countries with higher visa rejection rates may have lower tourist arrivals, especially for non-EU visitors.
Safety and cost of living may moderate the impact of visa restrictionsâ€”i.e., some tourists might still visit a country despite strict visa policies if the country is safe and affordable.
Some countries may have high tourist numbers despite restrictive visas, likely due to visa exemptions for certain nationalities.
# 6. Limitations and Future Work
The dataset does not account for visa-free agreements (e.g., Schengen Visa).
External factors such as COVID-19 travel restrictions may distort recent visa statistics.
Future work could incorporate economic indicators (GDP, exchange rates) to refine insights on tourism demand.
