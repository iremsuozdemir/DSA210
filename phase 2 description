# Visa Rejection and Tourism Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **visa rejection rates** and **tourism volume** using two datasets: one containing visa statistics and another detailing tourism metrics for various countries.

## üìÖ Project Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Merged two datasets on `country` after standardizing names (lowercased, trimmed).
- Converted categorical values for `Safety` and `Cost of Living` to numerical levels:
  - Low = 1
  - Medium = 2
  - Medium-High = 3
  - High = 4
- Converted `Approximate Annual Tourists` from strings like "14 million" to actual float values.
- Dropped rows with missing or invalid data in key columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visa Refusal Rate Histogram**:
  - Right-skewed distribution.
  - Most countries have **low refusal rates**.
  - Indicates lenient visa policies in general, with a few outliers.

- **Scatter Plot: Visa Refusal Rate vs Tourist Volume**:
  - Weak negative trend.
  - High refusal rates correlate with lower tourist counts.
  - Outliers exist, but overall direction aligns with hypothesis.

- **Correlation Heatmap**:
  - Weak correlation (`~ -0.02`) between visa refusal rate and tourist volume.
  - Stronger internal correlations among visa metrics (e.g., issued vs. not issued).

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- Conducted a two-sample **t-test** comparing tourist volumes:
  - **Group 1:** Countries with high visa refusal rates (above median).
  - **Group 2:** Countries with low visa refusal rates (below median).
- **Results:**
  - T-statistic = `-17.14`
  - P-value = `1.03e-65`
- **Conclusion:**
  - The difference in tourist volume between the two groups is **statistically significant**.
  - Lower visa refusal countries attract **significantly more tourists** on average.

## üìê Key Insights
- Visa policy is **not the sole factor**, but a **significant one** influencing tourist inflow.
- Countries aiming to boost tourism should consider more flexible visa procedures.
- Clean preprocessing and variable transformation are critical for valid analysis.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## üí° Future Improvements
- Expand analysis with regression including more variables (Safety, Cost of Living).
- Introduce additional datasets (e.g., economic indicators, travel advisories).
- Deploy interactive visualizations via Dash or Streamlit.
